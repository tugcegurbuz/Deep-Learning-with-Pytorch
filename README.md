# Pytorch
Various deep learning exercises by using Pytorch

* **Transfer Learning: I applied transfer learning to binomial and multinomial image classification task.** 
  * Binomial: 
    * Bees vs Ants dataset; Fine-tuned model: AlexNet
  * Multinomial: 
    * MNIST handwritten digist dataset (10 categories). Fine-tuned model: AlexNet
    * Chest x-ray (14 categories). Fine-tuned model: DenseNet
    
* **Image Segmentation: I applied image segmentation with U-Net**
  * 3D U-Net: Segmenting brain tumors from MRI dataset
